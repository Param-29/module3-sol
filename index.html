        Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.[1] Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.

		Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among many others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat. 
		The modern chicken is a descendant of red junglefowl hybrids along with the grey junglefowl first raised thousands of years ago in the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent.[4]

		Chicken as a meat has been depicted in Babylonian carvings from around 600 BC.[5] Chicken was one of the most common meats available in the Middle Ages.[6][7] For thousands of years, a number of different kinds of chicken have been eaten across most of the Eastern hemisphere,[8] including capons, pullets, and hens. It was one of the basic ingredients in blancmange, a stew usually consisting of chicken and fried onions cooked in milk and seasoned with spices and sugar.[9]

		In the United States in the 1800s, chicken was more expensive than other meats and it was "sought by the rich because [it is] so costly as to be an uncommon dish."[10] Chicken consumption in the U.S. increased during World War II due to a shortage of beef and pork.[11] In Europe, consumption of chicken overtook that of beef and veal in 1996, linked to consumer awareness of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease).

        Fish are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups.

		The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period. Although they lacked a true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed them to be more agile than their invertebrate counterparts. Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms. Many fish of the Paleozoic developed external armor that protected them from predators. The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as sharks) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods.

		Most fish are ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), allowing their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, though some of the large active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature.[1][2]

		Fish can communicate in their underwater environments through the use of acoustic communication. Acoustic communication in fish involves the transmission of acoustic signals from one individual of a species to another. The production of sounds as a means of communication among fish is most often used in the context of feeding, aggression or courtship behaviour.[3] The sounds emitted by fish can vary depending on the species and stimulus involved. They can produce either stridulatory sounds by moving components of the skeletal system, or can produce non-stridulatory sounds by manipulating specialized organs such as the swimbladder.[4]

        	From leafy greens to cruciferous veggies, produce is a little gift from nature to us humans. Filled with crucial immune-boosting antioxidants, fiber, B-vitamins, and minerals, they’re the "real deal" that can make a big impact on your health. The beauty of vegetables? The more you eat of all of them, the better off you are. Countless studies have linked the benefits to greater veggie intake to decreased risk of chronic disease, including heart disease, diabetes, and lifestyle-related cancers. Plus, observational data has linked adequate produce intake (at least five servings per day) to better mood and self-reported feelings of happiness and satisfaction.

			Since they contain lots of water, vegetables are also essential for hydration and digestion while also providing fuel for your body’s beneficial bacteria to survive and thrive. The only thing to keep to a minimum? Breading and deep-frying your veggies, which turn a nutritious staple into a vehicle for extra refined carbs and saturated fat. That can add up if you’re preparing them with those methods frequently. Otherwise, choose a variety of veggies to bulk up your meals with nutritious flavor. Cook fresh and frozen produce by steaming, grilling, sautéing, or roasting — or enjoy it raw. If you go the canned route, pick types without added sugar or sodium. Here are a list of our top favorite vegetables, but keep in mind: Any veggie can belong on your menu, so choose what you love and use the rest as inspo for future meals and snacks you can enjoy in flavorful ways.
